# 90-120m Python class that assumes some knowledge of python, and xy coordinate planes
General structure is the `file`s are in order and there's my solutions in `solutions/file`. My solutions are the only way to do this.

## Prework
1. Install python3.x
2. Have a basic code or text editor installed. eg: Atom
3. Have access to PowerShell (Windows) or a Terminal (OSX and Linux)
If you need more advice than this on setup I'd suggest searching for Learn Python The Hard Way and following his prework examples. In fact if you don't have this prework already done I'd suggest getting through the first 20-30 exercises there before coming back to this.

## tree.py
Sets the turtle basics you'll see in the rest of the files. Using these attempt to draw a Christmas Tree.

You can see my 15min attempt.

## tree2.py
Bring it back a bit and focus on a smaller thing. We start introducing variables and functions.

## tree3.py
From the example function of how to draw a stump can you write a function to draw a tree branch

## tree4.py
Put it in a loop and figure out how to end it.

## tree5.py
Abstract it a bit and just define the height and number of branches.
